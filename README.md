# Purpose

The purpose of [the Weekend Warrior API](https://weekend-warrior-api.herokuapp.com) is to provide a back-end interface for managing user input from the main front-end site. To this end, the API is responsible for creating, storing, updating and filtering user data, with the overall goal of making sure the Weekend Warrior site delivers on it's core functionality as a social media hub. By it's nature, Weekend Warrior will only be successful if the user is able to quickly navigate and seamlessly interact with the functionality of the site - it is vital therefore that the API is designed to fit the audiences' needs.
  
The API allows users to register an account, and in doing so create a unique profile that they are then able to edit. They can also view others' profiles and choose to follow/unfollow other users (a standard practise with social media sites). In addition to this, once authenticated, users are able to **post** their recent 'adventures', **comment** on others' posts and also **favourite** posts so that they can easily access them at a later date.

## Acknowledgements

* The Code Institute walkthrough projects 'Hello Django' and 'I Think Therfor I Blog' for providing some structure and direction for my personal project.
* A special mention to my mentor Martina Terlevic who has accomodated me along the way, supporting with queries 'on the fly' and providing invaluable guidance during project milestone meetings. 
* I have enormous gratitude for the patience, and experience offered by tutor support members: Oisin, Rebecca and Martin. All three helped me work through problems systematically and those processes themselves taught me a great deal with regards to debugging and **reading** code.
* I also want to thank [Chris.F](https://github.com/Chrisfaherty) and [Chris.B](https://github.com/Christoph33one) (fellow Code Institute students). By joining together and engaging in remote study sessions your conversation and input kept me on track and motivated to push myself with regards to the project. By regularly talking through our code, I'd like to think we replicated as much of the 'agile' process as we could!
